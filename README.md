# Project-Web-Scrapped-Stock-Prices

🗓️ This is a three month web scrapping project on Bed Bath and Beyond stock prices. The open and close prices show a gradual decline in the company's stock. This is likely due to company downsizing and eventual bankruptcy.

🔭 A challenge of this project was scrapping the right data from Yahoo Finance and monitoring the scrapping function so it would not crash. One issue that needed debugging was the formatting of the dataset that the data was placed in. Using BeautifulSoup and parsing the date column was done to get the right data.

🤔 If given more time, six months of data would have been collected to see any future changes in the stock price
